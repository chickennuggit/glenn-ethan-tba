# Untitled Text-Based Adventure
###### Glenn and Ethan set off to work on a text-based adventure game. Insanity ensues.

### First and foremost...
This gh-pages branch is for Glenn and I to test the game easily from anywhere. Up until release of the game, it will serve this one purpose. Once the game is finalized and translated to C++, this will serve as a homepage to download the game.
